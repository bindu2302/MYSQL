Triggers: A Trigger, in the context of databases, is a special type of Stored procedure that automatically executes or fires in response to specific events on
particular tables or views. These events can include actions like insert,update,delete.

Benefits of Triggers in MySQL:

1. Automatic Actions: Triggers run automatically before or after changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), ensuring consistent behavior without 
   writing extra code in applications.
2. Data Integrity Enforcement: You can enforce business rules at the database level (e.g., prevent negative balances).
3. Audit Logging: Automatically log changes to a table (e.g., who changed what and when).
4.Cascade Changes: Keep related tables in sync (e.g., auto-update a timestamp in a parent table when a child table is modified).
5.Reduced Application Logic: Business rules stay in the database rather than being duplicated in multiple application layers.

Syntax:
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- trigger logic here
END;
//

DELIMITER ;
