-- indexes: An index in sql is a databse object,that provides fast and effient way to locate the rows in a table. A index is significantly improve the 
-- query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate the rows matching specified conditions.

-- Action	SQL Example:   Create Index	CREATE INDEX find_Id ON users(id);
-- Use Index:              SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 2; (auto)
-- Check Usage:             Use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN PLAN
-- Drop Index: 	              Depends on DB: mySQL/Postgres: DROP INDEX find_Id; Oracle: DROP INDEX find_Id;  SQL Server: DROP INDEX find_Id ON users;

-- TIP: However, indexes are used automatically by the database when you write queries that benefit from them—you don’t call them explicitly in your query.

-- Benefits: 
-- 1.Faster Query Performance
-- 2. Improves Sorting and Searching
-- 3. Supports Uniqueness
-- 4. Speeds Up JOIN Operations
-- 5. Helps with Aggregate Functions

select *  from users where id=2; -- before index usage
create index find_Id on users(id);
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 2;  -- after index usage
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 2;
drop index find_Id on users;


select * from employee where emp_name = 'anitha';
create INDEX Employee_NAME on employee(emp_name);
select * from employee where emp_name = 'anitha';
EXPLAIN select * from employee where emp_name = 'anitha';
drop index Employee_Name on employee;
